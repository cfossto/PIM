# PIM
*School project: Personal Information Manager-app for the web*

PIMER is a Personal Information Manager with quite some cool features. It handles the creation of customizable notes, including both pictures/files
and autodetection of hyperlinks. The app is equipped with an interactive sorting system for your notes - as well as a search function and all the edit tools you would need to organize your life.

PIMER is connected to a relational database through a costumized Java server/backend through Java Express and a Sqlite JDBC.
